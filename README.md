## Overview

Welcome to the **Language Model from Scratch** project! This repository is dedicated to building a sophisticated language model using PyTorch and other essential libraries. Our aim is to create a robust and efficient model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. This project includes everything from data preprocessing and model architecture design to training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Features âœ¨

- **Custom Model Architecture**: Implementation of cutting-edge neural network architectures designed for NLP tasks.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Advanced data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation techniques for handling large text datasets.
- **Comprehensive Training Pipeline**: End-to-end training pipeline with features like batching, gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpointing.
- **Robust Evaluation Metrics**: A suite of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the model's performance on language modeling, text generation, and classification tasks.
- **Seamless Inference and Deployment**: Tools and scripts for model inference and deployment, including API integration and real-time text generation.
